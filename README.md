## Cooling Centre Finder a.k.a. "Stay Cool TO"

The purpose of this application is to tell the user where the closest cooling centre is in Toronto, relative to their current location.

The application obtains a list of cooling centres available to the public when it is very hot outside. Overall description available here:

Quoting from the page:

"Toronto Public Health monitors the Heat Health Alert System every day from May 15 to September 30 each year, to alert those people most at risk of heat-related illness that hot weather conditions presently exist and to take appropriate precautions. One such precaution is the availability of buildings that are open to the general public that offer an air-conditioned space for temporary relief from the extreme heat."
